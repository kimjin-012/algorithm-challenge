# Algorithm Challenges

##About this repository
Here is where I upload my Algorithm pratice files.
Algorithm plays essential role in programming, they are our tools in coding and to be a great Developer, it is important to be practice algorithm.
Because:
- Algorithms are everywhere in our codes.
- It helps us increase our problem solving skills
- They helps us writes more cleaner and easier code.

Becoming a Algorithm master is a long road. I hope by creating this seperate algorithm repository would motivate me to commit to practice ðŸ˜„

I find the varieties of questions from many website, such as:
*HackerRank
*Leetcode

Thank you, for checking out this page.
